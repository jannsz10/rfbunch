{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:rfbunch} calculates reduced form bunching estimates for the main running variable {depvar} and alternative response variables {indepvars} using polynomials.

{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
rfbunch first estimates polynomial density estimates of the counterfactual density
 of the running variable, excluding the bunching region. If "adjust" is specified,
 rfbunch repeatedly shifts the running variable above the cutoff until the missing
 mass above the cutoff is equal to the excess mass in the bunching region, either 
 by shifting bin counts up ("y", Chetty et al. 2011) or by shifting observations 
 to the right and reconstructing bins ("x", Andresen and Thorvaldsen, 2021).

{pstd}
If alternative endogenous variables are specified, for each of them rfbunch estimates
 a polynomial relationship between this variable and the running variable separately
 below and above the cutoff and then backs out estimates of the mean of this variable 
 a) among nonbuchers in the bunching region, b) among bunchers and c) for bunchers' 
 counterfactual allocation.

{pstd}
rfbunch does not report standard errors, but standard errors can easily be obtained 
by using bootstrap.
